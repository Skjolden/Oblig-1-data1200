          FROG IN WELL
      </h2>
      <p><cite>Frog in well</cite> is undoubtebly one of my favorite works. It represents the freedom the frog feels without realising it is <strong>stuck forever</strong> in a well.
    This artwork was <em>inspired by a frog </em> i met named Javier. Javier was stuck in a well for days, but never tried to climb out. <cite>"I might not be free, but i am well"</cite> are 
the words he spoke and lived by.    </p>

<h2>MY CHEESE IS NOW THE QUEENS</h2>

<p> I painted <cite>My cheese is now the queens</cite> to show my patriotic love for the british empire. I never really met the queen, but being an artist i painted myself giving her 
    cheese. Cheese is a <em>symbol</em> that represents many feelings. The circular structure of the cheese represents how one must <strong>"ROLL ON"</strong> even through the hardest
    of times. My hardest time was when the queen nearly had me executed for sneaking into her chambers.
