          FROG IN WELL
      </h2>
      <p><cite>Frog in well</cite> is undoubtebly one of my favorite works. It represents the freedom the frog feels without realising it is <strong>stuck forever</strong> in a well.
    This artwork was <em>inspired by a frog </em> i met named Javier. Javier was stuck in a well for days, but never tried to climb out. <cite>"I might not be free, but i am well"</cite> are 
the words he spoke and lived by.    </p>
