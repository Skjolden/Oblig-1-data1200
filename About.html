                <h2>Lord McMuffin</h2>
                <p>Lord Hedonius Jeremiah McMuffin lives in his castle in southern England with his 4th wife, 
                Lady Marcella Isadorah McMuffin (née. Cockbottom). He has 9 children, 2 from his current marriage.
                He owns 7 cheese factories, and is the largest producer of cheese in all of England!
                Lord Mcmuffin enjoys hunting pheasants, evening walks, and have been painting for the last 78 years.</p>

                <h2>The project</h2>
                <p>We created the fictional character Lord McMuffin as representative of the group. We agreed that the layout
                of the site should be stylish as to show the profesionality of the character. Yet not too excessive, so it would
                appear readable and clean to the visitor. We chose to use Article and Div Card tags to to create a surface area
                of text that appears centrally on the screen, also so that the text would not blur in with the background image.
                The grey colour of the cards was chosen because it blended in with the background image, and also it creates
                a nice contrast to the white text.
