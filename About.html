    <h2>About Lord McMuffin</h2>

    Lady Marcella Isadorah McMuffin (n√©e. Cockbottom). He has 9 children, 2 from his current marriage.
    He owns 7 cheese factories, and is the largest producer of cheese in all of England!
    Lord Mcmuffin enjoys hunting pheasants, evening walks, and have been painting for the last 78 years.</p>

    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>We created the fictional character Lord McMuffin as representative of the group. We agreed that the layout
        of the site should be stylish as to show the profesionality of the character. Yet not too excessive, so it would
        be readable and clean to the visitor.
